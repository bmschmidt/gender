#' Find the gender of frst names using Social Security data
#' 
#' This internal function implements the \code{method = "ssa"} option of 
#' \code{\link{gender}}. See that function for documentation.
#' 
#' @param data A character string of a first name or a data frame with a column 
#'   named \code{name} with a character vector containing first names. The names 
#'   must all be lowercase. 
#' @param years This argument can be either a single year, a range of years in 
#'   the form \code{c(1880, 1900)}, or the value \code{TRUE}. If no value is 
#'   specified, then the names will be looked up for the period 1932 to 2012. If
#'   a year or range of years is specified, then the names will be looked up for
#'   that period. If the value is \code{TRUE}, then the function will look for 
#'   a column in the data frame named \code{year} containing an integer vector
#'   of the year of birth associated with each name. This permits you to do a 
#'   precise lookup for each person in your data set. Dates may range from 1880 
#'   to 2012; if earlier or later dates are included in a column in the data 
#'   frame, they will not be matched.
#' @param certainty A boolean value, which determines whether or not to return
#'   the proportion of male and female uses of names in addition to determining
#'   the gender of names.
